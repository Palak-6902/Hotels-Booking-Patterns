## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes hotel booking data from an online travel platform to uncover patterns in customer behavior, booking trends, and cancellation rates. The goal is to derive actionable business insights that can help improve profitability, customer retention, and operational efficiency.

## **Tools and Technologies Used**

* Python (Data Analysis & Visualization)
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* Excel (Preliminary Data Review and Cleaning)
* Jupyter Notebook (Code Execution and Reporting)

## **Key Analyses Performed**

* Booking Pattern Analysis
  * Examined how bookings vary across channels, room types, and star ratings.
  * Found that Web (50%) and Mobile App (40%) dominate bookings, while Travel Agents contribute only 10%.
  * Standard rooms were most popular (~16,552 bookings), indicating price-sensitive customer behavior.

* Cancellation Behavior
  * Overall cancellations: ~20%
  * Majority from Standard rooms (63%).
  * Cancellations are higher among bookings without coupons (79%) and with refunds (78%), indicating flexible booking behavior.

* Property Type Performance
  * Certain property categories performed better in terms of booking value and stay length.
  * Web and Android platforms contributed higher average revenues.

* Seasonal and Temporal Trends
  * Spring recorded the highest average booking value.
  * Weekends (especially Saturday) showed longer stays compared to weekdays.

## **Insights and Key Findings**

* Customers prefer direct digital platforms (Web/App) for ease and transparency.
* Refund and no-coupon bookings lead to higher cancellation rates.
* Standard rooms dominate due to affordability and accessibility.
* Moderate star-rated properties (3–4 stars) receive the majority of bookings.
* Booking activity slightly peaks during Spring and weekends.

## **Business Recommendations**

* Reduce Cancellations: Implement clear refund and cancellation policies to prevent casual cancellations. Encourage prepaid and coupon-based bookings to enhance commitment and reduce refund-related losses.
* Increase Profitability and Repeat Bookings: Introduce loyalty rewards and personalized offers for repeat guests. Promote Deluxe rooms with bundled deals to raise average revenue per booking.
* Optimize Pricing and Channel Strategy: Use data-driven dynamic pricing to match demand trends. Improve mobile app performance and strengthen high-performing channels with seasonal promotions to maximize reach and conversions.
